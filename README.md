# Austin-Animal-Shelter-Project

# Project Description
This project is to delve into Austin's Animal Shelter statistics to see how an animal was onboarded and what that particular animal's outcome was. With the data acquired, it can be used to discover trends in what influences an animal's outcome. With the trends discovered, it could be possibly used to strategically produce a program that could increase the chances of an animal having a positive outcome.

# Initial Thoughts
My intitial thoughts on this project is that an animal's outcome will be heavily influenced by their age and breed. Their color will have a small influence on their chances at being adopted. I also wanted to explore if their time in shelter somehow made them less desireable to potential adoptive parents.
